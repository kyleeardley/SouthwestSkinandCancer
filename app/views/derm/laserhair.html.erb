  <h2>Laser Hair Removal</h2>
 <p>
Laser hair removal uses a low-energy laser to gently remove unwanted hair. The laser energy passes through the skin and is absorbed by the pigment in the hair follicle. In a fraction of a second, many of the treated hair follicles are injured by the heat generated by the laser. Laser treatments can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours depending on the size of the area being treated. <br><br>With the exception of the region close to the eye, almost any area of the body with excess hair can be treated with lasers. The most common areas requested by patients are the face, upper lip, neck, chest, periareolar (breast region), underarms, back, abdomen, bikini line and legs.
