  <h2>Botox</h2>
 <p>
 Botox is a simple, non-surgical, physician-administered treatment that can temporarily smooth moderate to severe frown lines between the brows in people from 18 to 65 years of age. It is the only treatment of its type approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

One 10-minute treatment-a few tiny injections-and within days there's a noticeable improvement in those persistent lines between the brows, which can last up to 4 months. Results may vary.

 <h2>Juvederm</h2>
 <p>
Juvéderm, an injectable filler (injectable facial filler), is used by cosmetic, dermatological, and plastic surgeons to soften deep folds and reduce wrinkles in the faces of patients.   Juvéderm’s prime use is removing nasolabial folds, or “smile lines,” creases of skin which run from the corners of the nose to the corners of the mouth. It is also used as a lip augmentation agent, and to fill in hollow places and scars on the face. However, all hyaluronic acid facial filler products are eventually absorbed by the body, usually within six to nine months, thus requiring follow visits to maintain the younger look. Juvéderm is also used by physicians to plump lips, which also lose fat and internal shape with normal aging.

  <h2>Fraxel Laser Skin Treatments</h2>
 <p>
Until now, two varieties of laser treatment have been available for cosmetic enhancement-ablative and non-ablative. Ablative, which literally means to vaporize at a very high temperature, are very effective at destroying unwanted tissue but have significant side-effects and require a lengthy healing period. Non-ablative, on the other hand, have very few side-effects and require almost no healing time, but involve numerous treatments over many months to achieve only modest results.<br><br>

At long last, a laser with the potency of ablative treatments and the gentle safety of non-ablative lasers has won approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to treat a variety of important cosmetic conditions.<br><br>

Fraxel® Laser Treatment is designed to target aging and damaged skin by creating microscopic "wounds" within the targeted areas well beneath the skin's outermost layer. In this way, Fraxel® Laser treatments trigger the body's own natural production of new collagen and skin cells. And because Fraxel® Laser Treatment combines the impact of ablative lasers with the gentleness of non-ablative lasers, healing occurs so quickly that there is very little downtime for patients.

<h2>Fraxel For Acne Scars</h2>
 <p>
 Anyone double-burdened with watching their teenage acne turn into adult acne scars knows the profound devastation this circumstance can have on self-esteem and life-outlook. Yet, every bit as profound is the utter transformation - physical and emotional - awaiting those who take advantage of a revolutionary change recently underway in cosmetic health.<br><br>

Acne scars form wherever acne advances to the point of injuring our tissue. These injuries arise as an inflammatory response to sebaceous follicles becoming plugged with oils, bacteria and dead cells. The result is the formation of a scar - that discolored fibrous tissue with abnormal collagen function that replaces our healthy skin. Successful treatment of a scar requires both the removal of damaged epidermal tissue and the stimulation of new collagen to improve the region's tone and texture.<br><br>	

Traditional approaches - topical agents, abrasion therapies, surgery and conventional lasers - either achieve only moderate results, or else destroy unacceptable amounts of healthy tissue along with the scar. The more effective techniques can also require a great deal of recovery time.<br><br>

A monumental breakthrough came only recently when the FDA approved Fraxel® Laser Treatment for acne scars after studies showed that the new laser could be far more effective than traditional therapies at both removing damaged tissue and inducing the formation of new collagen.

 <h2>Fraxel For Age Spots</h2>
 <p>
 Although the appearance of age spots might seem like an obvious indication of aging skin, they are instead our body's attempt to protect itself from sun exposure by overproducing melanin. Also called liver spots or sun spots, age spots are blemishes that range in color from dark yellow to black and locate themselves in exposed areas of the body, such as the face, hands, shoulders, arms or forehead.<br><br>

Even when harmless, these blotchy brownish patches pose a tough cosmetic challenge that can make us look and feel much older than our years.<br><br>

Conventional strategies for eliminating age spots include cryotherapy, acid washes, bleaches, pulsed light or traditional laser treatment. Too often such techniques will fade but not completely remove age spots.

The real breakthrough came recently when the FDA approved Fraxel Laser Treatment® for age spots after studies showed that the new laser could be far more effective than traditional therapies.

<h2>Fraxel For Wrinkles</h2>
 <p>
  Wrinkles around the eyes, often called crow's feet, are categorized by doctors as dynamic wrinkles because they develop largely from years of contracting the muscles that display our emotions when we smile, squint, deeply consider, show surprise or laugh. If you've developed such wrinkles yourself, we're happy to hear that life has dealt you so many rich emotional experiences! Now, about those wrinkles.<br><br>

There are countless cosmetic strategies for reducing crow's feet-including acid peels, injectable fillers, collagen, dermabrasion or traditional laser treatment. These techniques can achieve moderately successful results for many patients.<br><br>

The real breakthrough came recently when the FDA approved Fraxel® Laser Treatment for wrinkles around the eyes after studies showed that the new laser could be far more effective than traditional therapies.

  <h2>Laser Hair Removal</h2>
 <p>
Laser hair removal uses a low-energy laser to gently remove unwanted hair. The laser energy passes through the skin and is absorbed by the pigment in the hair follicle. In a fraction of a second, many of the treated hair follicles are injured by the heat generated by the laser. Laser treatments can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours depending on the size of the area being treated. <br><br>With the exception of the region close to the eye, almost any area of the body with excess hair can be treated with lasers. The most common areas requested by patients are the face, upper lip, neck, chest, periareolar (breast region), underarms, back, abdomen, bikini line and legs.

<h2>Lip Fusion</h2>
 <p>
Lip Fusion's revolutionary, breakthrough formulas harness the clinically proven plumping powers of patented micro-injected™technology, making LipFusion the #1 selling lip plumper in America.The beauty-boosting benefits of dehydrated collagen and hyaluronic acid microspheres use your body’s natural water to deliver a fullout sexy, perfectly plump pout, instantly and painlessly, for up to 48 hours.<br><br>

Many products claim 'collagen' as a featured ingredient, when, in truth the collagen molecules are too large to penetrate the skin. LipFusion harnesses the clinically proven plumping and hydrating powers of new-patented marine collagen-filling spheres. This revolutionary technology dehydrates the collagen molecule into tiny microspheres in order to penetrate, or micro-inject, into the lips and then search for the body's natural water to re-hydrate, creating a beautifully natural, full-out pout.

<h2>Trend Skin</h2>
 <p>
Many great inventions and discoveries in the world were unintentional or just plain accidents. The story you are about to read concerning a breakthrough in the cosmetics field relates another great accidental discovery.<br><br>

In 1985, in an office in South Florida, a dentist was working on a patient. The patient was a private investigator. Medication was given to the patient to alleviate the pain associated with his treatment. Two days later, the patient noticed a dramatic improvement not only in the pain level, but in his skin as well. His face, which was full of razor bumps, had cleared up!<br><br>

The man couldn't wait to tell the dentist what had happened. Early the next morning, he visited the dentist's office. "Doc, Doc! What did you give me? What was it?" The dentist was scared. He thought something was wrong, "Doc! Look! Look! My face is cleared up! My razor bumps are gone!"<br><br>

The dentist, obviously confused, exclaimed, "What in the world are you talking about? What the heck are razor bumps?"<br><br>

The investigator began to tell the dentist how important this discovery was. He mentioned that the dozens of products already on the market did not come close to producing the dramatic results he had achieved.<br><br>

Realizing that the ingredient could not be taken internally for long periods of time, the two men experimented with the formula in an attempt to apply it directly to the skin. Eight long years of lab work, tests, and patents produced a very effective formula. The dentist had a great discovery.<br><br>

Other uses for the formula arose in the same "chance" way that the formula was discovered. Women who bought the product for their husbands or boyfriends started trying it on the perpetual ingrown hair problems they had from shaving, waxing, and having electrolysis on their legs, bikini lines, and underarms. Not only did they report to the dentist that the ingrown hair problems had cleared, but that the formula worked as an excellent underarm deodorant.<br><br>
